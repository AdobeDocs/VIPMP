# Manage high volume discounts

Adobe extends volume discounts through its Three-year commitment (3YC) program, which is a loyalty program offering greater discount levels and a price lock for three terms (the current term and two additional terms). Customers must commit to a Minimum Commit Quantity (MCQ) that they will purchase and maintain throughout the 3-year period.

For 3YC customers, Adobe provides high penetration seat expansion offers for those purchasing 100 or more licenses, with discounts of up to 45%. Additional discounts are determined based on the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ), which defines the initial purchase quantity and the associated discount rate. Any subsequent purchases will adhere to the customer’s MOQ.

Here are the discounts available based on the MOQ.

| MOQ Offers | Discount % |
|------------|------------|
| 100        | 35%        |
| 250        | 40%        |
| 500        | 45%        |

Customers can add more licenses or seats either mid-term or at the anniversary date. Each new addition will benefit from the same discount rate as their original MOQ. For example, if an organization initially purchases an MOQ of 100 and later adds 50 more seats in the same MOQ, the additional seats will also receive a 35% discount. Similarly, if the organization with an MOQ of 100 adds 300 more licenses, bringing the total to 400, the new purchases will still receive the 35% discount based on the original MOQ. Therefore, if future growth is expected, starting with a higher MOQ is advisable.

## Who is eligible for high penetration offers?

Enterprise customers aiming to expand significantly can access high penetration offers if they meet the following conditions:

1. Customers must be enrolled in the 3YC program.
2. Customers require a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of 100 or more. Based on their seat requirements, customers can choose from the available MOQ offers. For instance, if a customer already has 110 seats, they should consider selecting either the 250 or 500 MOQ option, as shown in the following table.

**Note:**

- MOQ offers aren't available to new customers and can only be purchased by existing qualifying customers who already have a certain number of licenses for specific product groups. Product groups can be defined at the time of onboarding. For example, Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro are part of the Acrobat group, and customers having a combined quantity of 55 of these products will only qualify for Acrobat Pro MOQ 100 offer.

    | Current seats at renewal <br/> Acrobat Pro + Standard|Eligible Minimum Order Quantity (MQO)  |
    |--|--|
    |≤ 50 seats| 100 <br /> 250 <br /> 500|
    |≤ 125 seats|100 <br /> 250  |
    |≤ 250 seats |500 |

The number of subscriptions at the renewal date on the anniversary date must be greater than or equal to the number of seats committed. The following table lists the seat expansion scenarios during renewals:

| Current seats at renewal <br/> Acrobat Pro + Standard|Eligible Minimum  Order Quantity (MOQ)  |3YC minimum commitment quantities <br /> (needs to be increased based on MOQ) |
|--|--|--|
|≤ 50 seats| 100 <br /> 250 <br /> 500| 100+ |
|≤ 125 seats|100 <br /> 250  | 250+ |
|≤ 250 seats |500 | 500+|

## High penetration offer renewal workflows

Adobe defines the MOQ offers with the pricing pool bit. The pricing pool bit is the third bit from the last in the offer ID provided to partners. For example:

- 65304479CA04X12 = Acrobat Pro 100 MOQ Pack
- 65304479CA04Y12 = Acrobat Pro 250 MOQ Pack
- 65304479CA04Z12 = Acrobat Pro 500 MOQ Pack

The workflow for various actions are as follows:
