**Sai:** `Need an overview of customer accounts, market segments and three-year commits. I just added some general info about customer accounts.`

Managing customer accounts is vital in enabling the purchase of products. You can use  the following APIs to manage customer accounts:

* [Get details of a customer account](./get_customer_account.md)
* [Get license of a customer](./get_licenses.md)
