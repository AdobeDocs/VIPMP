## Market segments

Market segmentation is an internal convention used to inform the internal stakeholders about the product or business intent, to have one or more of the following differentiations:

- **Price range** <br />**Example**: Pricing for the Education segment is typically lower than that for the Commercial pricing.
- **Product certification** <br /> **Example**: Education-ready and Government-ready software and services are required to meet more stringent Adobe legal, safety, privacy, and trust requirements.
- **Purchasing qualification** <br />
    **Example:** Customers are typically required to prove their association with government-related agencies or educational institutions to buy the product at a different price range. For individuals buying education plans on Adobe-direct, Adobe verifies their education status with a third-party identity verification service.

These are the three market segments available for Adobe products:

| Value | Description                 |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| COM   | Commercial <br /> (default) |
| EDU   | Education                   |
| GOV   | Government                  |

The education market segment mentioned in the above table is further divided into K-12, higher education, and non-profit, as listed in the following table:

| Value      | Description                               | Offers available to purchase                                                    |
