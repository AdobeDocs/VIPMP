# Manage market segments

Market segmentation is an internal convention used to inform the internal stakeholders about the product or business intent, to have one or more of the following differentiations:

* **Price range**

    **Example**: Pricing for the Education segment is typically lower than that for the Commercial pricing.
* **Product certification**

    **Example**: Education-ready and Government-ready software and services are required to meet more stringent Adobe legal, safety, privacy, and trust requirements.
* **Purchasing qualification**

    **Example**: Customers are typically required to prove their association with government-related agencies or educational institutions to buy the product at a different price range. For individuals buying education plans on Adobe-direct, Adobe verifies their education status with a third-party identity verification service.

These are the three market segments available for Adobe products:

| Value | Description                   |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| COM   | Commercial <br /> (default) |
| EDU   | Education                     |
| GOV   | Government                    |

The education market segment mentioned in the above table is further divided into K-12, higher education, and non-profit, as listed in the following table:

| Value      | Description                               | Offers available to purchase                                                  |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| K_12       | K-12 School (Primary or Secondary School) | - EDU offers without a sub-segment.  <br /> - EDU offers with K-12 sub-segment. |
| HIGHER_ED  | Higher Education Institution              | - EDU offers without a sub-segment. <br /> - EDU offers with HED sub-segment.     |
| NON_PROFIT | Non-profit Organization                    | - EDU offers without a sub-segment.        |

**Note:** The Additional Detail (Column P) in the price list file contains information on the sub-segment of an offer as well as the minimum purchase quantity, if applicable.

* If the offer has a sub-segment, the Additional Detail text begins with that subsegment (K-12 or HED).
* If the offer has a minimum purchase quantity, the Additional Detail text ends with that information.

**Example Additional Detail**: K-12 Shared Device Site Education License Lab and Classroom (100+)

* This offer is associated with the K-12 sub-segment and has a minimum purchase quantity of 100.
