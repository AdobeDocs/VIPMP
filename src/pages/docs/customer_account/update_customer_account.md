# Update customer account

You can modify certain attributes of a customer account by using the `PATCH /v3/customers/<customer-id>` endpoint.

## Contact management rules

1. Minimum contact requirement
   - Each customer must have at least one contact maintained through the API.
2. Sync with Admin Console
   - Every contact created or updated via the API will automatically reflect in the customer’s Admin Console as a System Admin.
3. Additional admins through Admin Console
   - Customers can add more admins directly in the Admin Console to manage their contract.
   - These additional admins will not sync back to the API.
4. Contact removal
   - Contacts can be removed through the API by omitting them from the list of contacts. However, once a contact has synced to the Admin Console, it will remain there unless the customer manually removes it in the Admin Console.
5. Contact updates
   - Email ID and phone number of a contact can be updated through the Update Customer API.
   - Contact name cannot be updated through API.
   - To change a contact’s name (like updating the company name), a support ticket must be raised along with a business justification.

## Sending a welcome email

Any contacts specified in the `Update Customer` call will receive the admin welcome email. If an end-user does not receive it, the partner should retry the `Update Customer` call, ensuring the admin contact’s email is included in the request.

## Usage instructions

Ensure that you are aware of the following before updating a customer account:

- Do not alter values for the mandatory fields such as `companyName, country,` and `region`. Otherwise, an error is returned.
- The `contacts` section specifies the admins for the customer's account.
  - Any contacts that are removed will remain admins. To remove admins, a customer admin must use the Adobe Admin Console.
- Customer market segment can be changed if the customer has no active subscriptions.
- Reseller must be enabled for the new market segment.
- Customer `externalReferenceId` may now be changed.
- Use either `commitmentRequest` or `recommitmentRequest`in the request to:

  - Request new 3YC for existing customers.
  - Request 3YC quantity increase for customers with existing commitment.
  - Request 3YC recommitment for customers with existing commitment.
    - Only allowed if the customer has a `COMMITTED` status for the commitment.

**Note:** Details of the request and response parameters are available in the [Resources](../references/resources.md#customer-top-level-resource) section of this documentation.
