# Manage deployments

For a global customer to purchase offers outside their home country, they must create and use deployment resources. If a partner is enabled for international sales, then they are allowed to enable customers for global sales. Once a customer has been enabled for global sales, they can create deployments with addresses outside of the customer’s country. These deployments can then be used to place orders for offers and currencies that that do not correspond to the customer’s address.

Use the following APIs to manage your deployments:

- [Create deployment](./create_deployment.md)
- [Get details of deployment](./get_deployment.md)
- [Update deployment](./update_deployment.md)
