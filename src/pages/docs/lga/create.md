# Create an LGA customer

It is recommended that distributors follow a defined process for setting up an LGA customer account and placing an order.

![Workflow for creating an LGA customer](../image/lga_create.png)

## APIs to create and manage an LGA customer

You need to use the following APIs at various steps of the workflow to create an LGA customer:

1. Create an LGA customer:

    - Create a customer: [POST /v3/customers](#1-create-an-lga-customer)
    - Verify customer details: [GET/v3/customers/{customer-id}](#2-get-customer-details)

2. Add LGA customers to a Linked Membership group. You can select one of these two options:

    - **Option 1:** Add LGA customer to an existing Linked Membership Group:
        - Search Linked Membership Groups: [GET /v3/linked_membership_groups](#3-search-linked-membership-groups)
        - Add to an existing group: [POST /v3/customers/{customer_id}/linked_membership/enroll/{linked_membership_id}](#4-add-an-lga-customer-to-an-existing-linked-membership-without-needing-an-authorization-code)
    - **Option 2:** Create a Linked Membership for the LGA customer:
        - [PATCH /v3/customers/{customer-id}](#4-add-an-lga-customer-to-an-existing-linked-membership-without-needing-an-authorization-code)

3. Place an order:

    - Preview Order API: [POST /v3/orders](../order_management/order_scenarios.md), with `orderType` set to `Preview`
    - Create Order API: [POST /v3/orders](../order_management/create_order.md), with `orderType` set to `NEW`

The subsequent sections explain these APIs in detail.

### 1. Create an LGA customer

Use the `POST /v3/customers` API to create an LGA customer. Here are the specifics that differ from the standard Create Customer request:

- The `benefits` array must include the `LARGE_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY` indicator for the LGA customer.
- The `marketSegment` should be set to `GOV` for LGA customers.
- The `marketSubSegments` field is mandatory for LGA customer creation and should have one of the following values:  `FEDERAL` or `STATE`.
