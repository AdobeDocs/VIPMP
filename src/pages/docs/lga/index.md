# Manage Large Government Agencies

Large government agencies (LGAs) in the US and Canada can get benefit from discounted Adobe licenses. To qualify for the best pricing, these agencies need at least 100 licenses. They can combine individual memberships through Linked Memberships to meet this minimum. Discount levels are based on the total number of licenses purchased, as listed in the following table:

| Discount levels| Number of licenses|
|--|--|
|Level 06 |100 - 999 |
|Level 07 |1000 - 4999 |
|Level 08 |5000 - 9999 |
|Level 09 |9999+ |

Only distributors enabled as LGA distributors for government customers can create and manage LGA customers. An LGA-enabled distributor can:

- [Create LGA customers](./create.md)
- [Migrate existing LGA customers from VIP to VIP Marketplace](./migrate.md)
- [Convert a customer in the Government market segment to an LGA customer](./convert.md)

**Note:** 3YC customers are not eligible for LGA discounts.
