# Migrate from VIP to VIP-MP

You can seamlessly transfer existing customers from VIP to VIP-MP. Customer consent can be obtained by sending the customer’s VIP Membership ID in the transfer request. You can use the [Preview Offers](./preview_offers.md) endpoint to check a customer’s eligibility for transfer and to preview the offers that need to be transferred for their existing VIP subscriptions.

## Eligibility rules for migration
