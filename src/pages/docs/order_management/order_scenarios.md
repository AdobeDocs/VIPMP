# Order creation scenarios

This topic provides details of the following scenarios related to order creation and management:

- [New order](#new-order)
- [Return or cancellation of order](#return-or-cancellation-of-order)
- [Preview an order](#preview-an-order)
- [Preview renewal orders](#preview-renewal-orders)
- [Renewal of order](#renewal-orders)

## New order

This section lists the sample requests and responses of an order with `orderType` - NEW.

**Notes:**

- The `subscriptionId` may be blank while the order is processing. Once the order is complete (status 1000), then all `subscriptionIds` will be populated and will not change.
- The [Create Order](./create_order.md) call is used to add seats for the current term.
- Order ID is created by this service and returned synchronously.
- Order may fail asynchronously, and status will be updated to reflect the failure.

### Sample request

```json
{
  "orderType": "NEW",
  "externalReferenceId": "759",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "extLineItemNumber": 4,
      "offerId": "80004567EA01A12",
      "quantity": 1,
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "deploymentId": "12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "referenceOrderId": "",
  "orderType": "NEW",
  "externalReferenceId": "759",
  "customerId": "9876543210",
  "orderId": "5120008001",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "creationDate": "2019-05-02T22:49:54Z",
  "status": "1002",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "extLineItemNumber": 4,
      "offerId": "80004567EA01A12",
      "quantity": 1,
      "status": "1002",
      "subscriptionId": "",
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "deploymentId": "12345"
    }
  ],
  "links": { ... }
}
```

## Return or cancellation of order

**Notes:**

- `referenceOrderId` is the order that is being returned.
- `referenceOrderId` must be a valid, returnable order.
  - Either NEW or RENEWAL.
- Line items being returned must match `extLineItemNumber`, `offerId`, and quantity of the original order:
  - Line items can be cancelled independently in the same or different RETURN order.
  - No partial line item cancellations.
- Same 1000 | 1002 | 1004 statuses.
- As line items from an order get cancelled, the line item status on the original order changes from 1000 to 1008.
  - When all line items for an order are cancelled, the status changes to 1008 for the original order.

### Sample request

```json
{
  "referenceOrderId": "0123456789",
  "orderType": "RETURN",
  "externalReferenceId": "759",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "extLineItemNumber": 4,
      "offerId": "80004567EA01A12",
      "quantity": 1,
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "deploymentId": "12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "referenceOrderId": "0123456789",
  "orderType": "RETURN",
  "externalReferenceId": "759",
  "orderId": "911000833",
  "customerId": "9876543210",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "creationDate": "2019-05-02T22:49:54Z",
  "status": "1002",
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "extLineItemNumber": 4,
      "offerId": "80004567EA01A12",
      "quantity": 1,
      "subscriptionId": "",
      "status": "1002",
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "deploymentId": "12345"
    }
  ],
  "links": { ... }
}
```

## Preview an order

The  `Create Order` API with `orderType` PREVIEW is a simulated order request that helps partners validate and prepare an order before actually placing it.

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders`         |   `POST`     |

The API returns structural and eligibility-related information about the order, but does not include pricing details unless explicitly requested.

A few of the advantages for previewing an order before placing an order include:

- Verifies customer eligibility for the requested offer.
Automatically adjusts the offer ID if a better volume discount is available.
- Prevents order failures by catching issues early, for example,  invalid discount codes, ineligible offers, and so on.
- Helps partners prepare a quote structure (line items, quantities, deployment IDs) before calculating pricing.
- Allows partners to test different configurations and offers.

 **<mark>Preview Order with pricing</mark>**

You can choose to include pricing in the Preview Order API response by setting the `fetch-price` query parameter to `true` in the request URL. This returns real-time partner pricing details for Adobe products, helping partners and resellers better estimate how much Adobe will invoice for an order.

Pricing data is sourced directly from Adobeâ€™s systems, reflecting official price lists, discounts, and proration logic.

**Notes:**

- Prices returned in the `Preview Order` and `Preview Renewal` API calls are calculated based on the Pacific Standard Time (PST) time zone.
- The pricing provided is an estimate based on the specific date and time of the request. Please note that placing an order at a different date or time may result in a different price.
- The pricing returned through this API reflects the commercial agreement between Adobe and the direct partner. Any pricing presented to end customers is determined by the reseller serving the end customer.
- Pricing details are not available in Preview Order and Preview Renewal scenarios for global sales involving multiple currencies.

### Usage instructions for Preview Order API

- Set `orderType` to PREVIEW
- A successful response can be used to place a new order request, if the `orderType` is changed to NEW.
- <mark>Include the query parameter `fetch-price=true` to retrieve pricing details.</mark>
- Returns the best available offer ID for the customer and the order.
  - Input Offer ID can be any level representing the same product.
  - If the Offer IDs in the request provides a better discount than customer is eligible for, then the correct lower-level Offer IDs are returned.
    - For a PREVIEW order, the request gets rejected if the customer is not eligible for an Offer ID.
-  If the `PREVIEW` order is rejected, then the `NEW` order will also fail with the same error.
- The `discountCode` is applicable only to High Volume Discount customers who have migrated from VIP to VIP MP. You can use the discount code only if their discount level in VIP is between 17 and 22.

### Request

**Sample request URL:** `<ENV>/v3/customers/{customer-id}/orders?fetch-price=true`

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description|
|--|--|
|customer-id |A unique identifier for the customer for whom the Order Preview request is being submitted. |
|fetch-price |A flag indicating whether pricing details should be included in the response. Possible values are: `true` or `false`  |

## Preview renewal orders

The `Create Order` API with `orderType` set to PREVIEW_RENEWAL allows partners to simulate a renewal order before the actual renewal is processed. This helps validate renewal eligibility, pricing, and offer availability in advance.

| Endpoint | Method |
|----------|--------|
| `/v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders`         |   `POST`     |

A few of the benefits of previewing a renewal order include:

- Validates renewal eligibility for existing subscriptions based on auto-renewal preferences.
- Returns the best available offer IDs for renewal, including High Growth Offers.
- Provides accurate pricing details for renewal scenarios, including discounts and proration logic.

### Usage instructions

- No `orderId`, `status`, and `links` in the request.
- In case of no `lineItems` in the request, the response indicates what would be in the RENEWAL order based on the auto-renewal preferences (`autoRenewal.enabled` and `autoRenewal.renewalQuantity`) on the customerâ€™s subscriptions.
- In case of `lineItems` in the request, the response indicates the RENEWAL order initiated after anniversary date for the selected line items.
- If the customer does not have any subscriptions with autoRenewal enabled, then an error is returned.
- Returns the best available offer IDs for the renewal order.
- The `eligibleOffers` section lists the High Growth Offers available for the customer. Read more about the [High Growth Offers](../customer_account/high_growth.md).
- The `discountCode` indicates the discount code applicable to the HVD customers migrating from VIP to VIP Marketplace. This parameter does not apply to non-HVD customers.
- The `lineItems []  â†’ status` parameter in the response adheres to standard status codes, for example, 1000 = Active, 1004 = Inactive, and so on. However, its interpretation is specific to the context of Preview Renewal Orders. For example:

  - **1000** indicates that the subscription is either active or scheduled and is expected to renew successfully.
  - **1004** indicates that the subscription is active or scheduled, but the associated product has expired, so the renewal will not proceed.
- <mark>Include the query parameter `fetch-price=true` to retrieve pricing details. Pricing details are not available in Preview Order and Preview Renewal scenarios for global sales involving multiple currencies.</mark>
- <mark>`proratedDays` in the response indicates the number of days for which order will be invoiced. This applies in the case of mid-term purchases. </mark>

## Renewal orders

**Notes:**

- RENEWAL order type is used for late renewals, which are initiated after the anniversary date.
- Subscription ID is required in the request line item.
- The license quantities must be less than or equal to customerâ€™s current subscription current quantities.
- Order ID is created by this service and returned synchronously.
- Partner Marketplaces are expected to check the status of the order for success.
- You can select the expired subscriptions for manual renewal by using the [Get All Subscriptions for a Customer](../subscription_management/get_details_for_customers.md) API. Subscriptions that can be selected for manual renewal are indicated by the `allowedActions`": `["MANUAL_RENEWAL"]` parameter of the Get All Subscriptions of a Customer API response.

- Renewals are managed at the subscription level. No new order is expected from the marketplace. If a customer has subscriptions set to auto-renew, Adobe creates a renewal order on the customer's `cotermDate`. The renewal Order ID can be retrieved by parsing the response from the [Get Order History](./get_order.md) API with `orderType` as RENEWAL.
- Offer IDs are defined and communicated in published price lists.
- Each Offer ID is valid only for certain currencies. The currency code sent in the request must match the Offer IDs as well as the currency for which the distributor is configured.
- `externalReferenceId` is used to pass in an ID for financial reconciliation.
  - The `externalReferenceId` does not need to be unique and is an optional field.
