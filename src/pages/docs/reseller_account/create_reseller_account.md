# Create a reseller account

Use the `POST /v3/resellers` API endpoint to create a reseller account.

## Assumptions

* Partner will present reseller with T&Cs and make this call after reseller agrees.
* Reseller Account ID is created by this service and returned synchronously.
* `externalReferenceId` should be used to pass in the marketplaceâ€™s identifier for the reseller.
  * Optional and does not need to be unique.
* Distributor ID -> Reseller ID -> Customer ID relationship must be unique.
* Synchronous call will return an account with status "1002" (Pending) while final validation happens asynchronously. The account may then become Active or Inactive. Pending resellers can create customers, but not update the reseller account.
* Contact names for existing email addresses cannot be changed through this API. If you send a different name for an existing email, that name will be returned in the synchronous response, but it will not persist in our system. The existing first and last name of the contact will be used and returned in any GET calls.
* Resellers can be created with optional market segments.
* If no market segments are sent, the reseller will be created with COM.
* Resellers may sell into multiple market segments but must always have at least one (default COM).
