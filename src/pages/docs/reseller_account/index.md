# Manage reseller accounts

As a first step to enable VIP - Marketplace, the marketplace presents Adobe Terms and Conditions to a reseller. If the reseller accepts the Terms and Conditions, the marketplace then creates an account for the reseller. You can use the following APIs to manage reseller accounts:

* [Create a reseller account](./create_reseller_account.md)
* [Get reseller account details](./get_reseller_account.md)
* [Update a reseller account](./update_reseller_account.md)
