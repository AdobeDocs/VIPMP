## Overview

Adobe caters to a diverse range of customers, including individuals, organizations across various industry sectors, educational institutions, and government agencies. Adobeâ€™s products are available either directly from Adobe or through third-party marketplaces like App Stores and VIP Marketplace.

The VIP Marketplace enables resellers to purchase the necessary Adobe licenses for their customers. This program offers the flexibility to purchase any number of licenses in a single transaction, with the option to add more as the organization expands.
