# Value Incentive Plan - Marketplace (VIP-MP)
Adobe sells its products to a wide spectrum of customers, from individuals to organizations of all sizes spanning numerous industry verticals, education, and government agencies. Adobe either sells directly to the customers or indirectly through third-party marketplaces such as App Stores and VIP-MP.  The Adobe Value Incentive Plan (VIP) is a subscription licensing program that makes it convenient for organizations and institutions of all sizes to purchase, deploy, and manage Adobe products. 

VIP Marketplace allows your reseller to purchase the Adobe licenses your team needs directly from a partner online ordering experience. They can purchase as many or as few licenses as you need in one simple transaction with the flexibility to add more as your organization grows.
