## Overview 

Adobe sells its products to a wide spectrum of customers, from individuals to organizations of all sizes spanning numerous industry verticals, education, and government agencies. Adobe either sells directly to the customers or indirectly through third-party marketplaces such as App Stores and VIP-MP.  

VIP Marketplace allows your reseller to purchase the Adobe licenses a customer team needs. They can purchase as many or as few licenses as you need in one simple transaction with the flexibility to add more as your organization grows.
