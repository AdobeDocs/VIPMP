# Manage distributors

An authorized sandbox portal user may have access to one or more direct partners. To switch between partners, the user can select their desired direct partner from the drop-down menu on the right side of the menu bar.

A Portal user may request access to more direct partners by contacting the partner administrator. It is important to note that having access to credentials does not automatically grant access to the Portal, and vice versa. While credentials can be shared as needed, Portal access is managed separately through the Portal.

## Enabling Partner for Global Sales in the Portal
