# View customer details

To access customer details, navigate to **Manage Records -> Created Records -> Customers**. The list of customers is sorted by creation date in descending order, showing the most recently created customers first.
A successfully created customer has a designated status of 1000 (Success).

Expand the view by clicking on the down arrow next to the customer ID to view a customer's detailed information. Expanding the **companyProfile** and **associations** fields also allows you to view additional information on the customer.

## Sort the customer list

You can sort the customer list by:

- Created date (default)
- Customer ID
- Status
- Name

The sorted order can be set either in descending (default) or ascending order. You can also adjust the number of customers shown per page to 10 (default), 20, 30, 50, or 100 by using the corresponding sorting dropdown menus.
