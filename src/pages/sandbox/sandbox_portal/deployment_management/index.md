For global customers to purchase offers outside their home country, they must create and use deployment resources. This topic will help you to:

- [Create a deployment](#create-a-deployment)
- [Update a deployment](#update-a-deployment)
- [Deactivate a deployment](#deactivate-a-deployment)
- [View deployments](#view-deployments)

## Create a deployment

You can create deployments using the [Commerce Partner API Postman Collection](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/VIPMarketplacePartners/PreRelease%20Materials/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=YyIk9K&CID=711c91d7-47d9-4d68-b83b-c15c1abbd860&FolderCTID=0x01200089886E87F1725140BF9E471CF714C925&id=%2Fsites%2FVIPMarketplacePartners%2FPreRelease+Materials%2FTechnical+Assets). Select the **Deployment Management** folder and select the `POST Create Deployment` request.

For more details on the API, refer to  [External API documentation](/src/pages/docs/index.md).
