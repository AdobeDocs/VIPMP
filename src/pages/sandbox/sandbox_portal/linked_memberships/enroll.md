## Generate Approval Code

To enroll in a linked membership, the linked owner must generate an approval code that any customer can use to join.

Perform the following steps to generate the approval code:

1. Go to the customer’s tab and expand the desired linked owner’s details.
2. Expand the **linkedAccountGroup** tree.
3. Select **Generate Linked Account Code**. This will generate a linked account code that is valid for 72 hours, which other customers can use to join the linked account group.

## Join a linked membership

Only customers who do not have active three-year commit benefits or are not part of other linked memberships can enroll in a linked membership.  To learn more about 3YC benefit status, see [Viewing 3YC status](../3yc_management/view_3yc_status.md).

**Note:** Members with active 3YC status: REQUESTED, ACCEPTED or COMMITTED cannot enroll in a linked membership.

To join a linked membership:

1. Select **Enroll to Linked Membership**. This will open a dialog box.
2. Enter the approval code provided by the linked membership owner.

## Refresh discount levels

To update the discount levels for all members of the linked membership:

1. Use the **Refresh Discount Level** button under **linkedAccountGroup** in the expanded customer view.
**Note:** Refresh runs asynchronously and will take more than an hour to update.
2. Check the last refresh time from the **lastRefreshDate** field in the same section to verify.
