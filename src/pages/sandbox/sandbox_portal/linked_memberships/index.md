# Manage linked memberships

Linked membership is an optional feature that allows customers to be linked into a linked account group. This enables affiliated organizations to aggregate their purchases across linked customers, achieving better volume discount levels while still managing and purchasing licenses separately.

Organizations benefit from a linked membership when their aggregated license quantity reaches or exceeds 10, making them eligible for higher discounts.

## Creating linked memberships

Linked memberships can be created in one of the two ways:

- When a Partner (or support) initiates the creation of a linked membership with a specified customer as the owner through the [Update Customer API](/src/pages/docs/customer_account/update_customer_account.md).
- When the owner of a linked membership transfers from VIP to VIP MP.

**Note:** Linked membership owners and members are not qualified for the three-year commitment benefits.
