# Product Recommendations

The Recommendations API empowers VIP Marketplace partners to provide intelligent, personalized, and context-aware product suggestions, enhancing the customer experience through upsell, cross-sell, and add-on opportunities. For more details, see [Manage recommendations using APIs](/src/pages/docs/recommendations/apis.md) section in the Adobe Commerce Partner API documentation.

## Testing Recommendations in Sandbox

The standalone Recommendations API and certain existing APIs can fetch recommendations through query parameters, and these recommendations are now available in the Sandbox environment.

No updates have been made to the Sandbox UI, as recommendations will be delivered exclusively through the APIs.

Specific, hardcoded recommendations have been configured to facilitate integration and functional testing of the recommendations feature. These predefined rules are as follows:

**Note:** In production, recommendations will be context-aware and based on the customer's entitlements (products owned), and products that are already owned shall not be recommended.
