2. Here, you can either:

- Create a default reseller by clicking on the **Create Default Reseller** button. <br /> or <br />
- Create a default set of records by clicking on the **Create Default Set** button, which includes a reseller, a customer, an order, a membership, and a transfer.

When a default reseller has been successfully created, a confirmation message will be displayed, and a Default Reseller ID will be assigned, as shown in the following figure:
