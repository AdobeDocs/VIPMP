**Note:** DeploymentId will be populated only for global orders.

Furthermore, you can view details of any of the Customer’s orders by clicking on the VIEW button next to the Order Type, which will send you to the Manage Records -> Order page and display the order—essentially performing a Search by Order ID function.
