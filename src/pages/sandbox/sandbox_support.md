# Sandbox Support

We are always looking for ways to improve our partner developer experience. New features will be added to the portal over time. To request new features or if you have and questions or issues, please send an email to: `partnerapi-integration-support@adobe.com`.

Additionally, we have incorporated, where appropriate, a column named Get Support with links to automatically generate an email whenever you may experience an issue with the Portal. Simply click on the envelope icon where the issue was experienced, and the Portal will display information related to the issue along with a dropdown menu where you can choose the nature of the problem. The email will be sent when you click on the **Generate Email** button.
